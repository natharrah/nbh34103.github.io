	<h2>  Carolina Roots  </h2> 

	<p> Hello! Welcome to my webpage. In this section I will tell you a little more about myself. I was born and raised in Greensboro, NC. I have two siblings both whom attended University of Georgia as well. My sister, Lauren Harrah as just recently moved from New York City to Atlanta and this is the closest that we have lived near each other in nine years! My brother lives in Charlotte, NC and works for my dad. I grew up going to every NASCAR race for my dad use to be the team owner of the number 77 car. Since he sold his company, he now engineers transmissions and oil pumps for the Nascar cars and my brother rents them out to the lower companies. My favorite aspect about where I live in Norther Carolina is that the mountains are only 45 minutes away and the beach is only 3 hours away. This chart below displays the distance from my house to my three Favorite Beaches

	<h2> Not so lucky year in Ireland </h2>

	<p> After I graduated Walter Hines Page High School in 2014 I felt compelled to take a gap year doing youth ministries. I traveled to a very small town called Dromore and lived on my own. Coming from a city of about 300,000 people was a big difference to coming to a town of only about 5,000. This was a huge change for me and honestly one of the biggest challenges I had there. Another big challenge I had to face was the lack of people my age in the town. This town was one that was very oppressive and once people turned 18 they typically moved out of the whole country and moved to England. Though those were my two biggest challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed the youth in the town. I made really great relationships with them that I know will last a life time. It was amazing how I brought a new light to religion to all the young people.  Here is a link to my blog that I created during my gap year. <a href= "http://www.natharrahyfc.weeby.com"> www.natharrahyfc.weeby.com </a>

	<h2> Go Dawgs </h2>

	<p>
	Ever since I moved my sister in her freshman year at University of Georgia was I was 11, I completely fell in the with the school. The college town feel was what attracted me most and how all of Athens is centered around the school. Four short years later my brother followed my sister's footsteps and too attended the University of Georgia. When it came time to start my college tours and I wanted to keep an open mind so I toured other colleges. I quickly realized that no other school would compare to University of Georgia. After having a pretty miserable gap year in Ireland, I had the absolutely best time of my life my freshman year here. I met so many friends, and had the best time. Even though classes can be such a pain and enjoyed being back in school. I know enjoy attending class in order to get good grades. It is all a very rewarding process and I look forward to what my future has to offer.
